This project contains the implementation of the blog post cards
as detailed in the take-home test using the vanilla framework 
and the provided WordPress API endpoint.

I've tested index.html in Google Chrome successfully, although 
Firefox gave me CORS issues that I have not been able to address.

To Run:
 - Ensure that the two files are in a common directory.
 - Open index.html in Chrome.
